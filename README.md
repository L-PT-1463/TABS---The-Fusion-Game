# TABS-The_Fusion_Game

Description:

"TABS - The Fusion Game" is a custom gamemode/ruleset designed for Totally Accurate Battle Simulator's (TABS) sandbox mode. It offers a way to play between players with set rules and allows you to define a winner. It s based on unit fusions and dynamic progression through the factions, itself being based on fusions to work.

The Guide will, once it is created, give you easy access to all the rules. It'll include an easy-to-understand manual, featuring interactive menus for fusion recipes and faction unlockings. Players can easily navigate through the manual to learn the rules and mechanics of the gamemode. Notably when you win points, or "victories", or when you unlock factions. Both of which you can keep track of using the Scoreboard.
